# ctime

A new Flutter package project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Dart
[package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/),
a library module containing code that can be shared easily across
multiple Flutter or Dart projects.

For help getting started with Flutter, view our 
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials, 
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

### Example

```dart

import 'package:ctime/ctime.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: Text(MSTime(timestamp: 1504452142).getWeek().toString()),
      ),
    );
  }
}
